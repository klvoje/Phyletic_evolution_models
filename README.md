Models of phyletic evolution compatible with the R package paleoTS

This repository contains models of phyletic evolution compatible with Gene Hunt's R package paleoTS. Some models are new (like the early burst model), while other models are combinations of models already implemented in the paleoTS package (like stasis, random walk directional trend and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model.
